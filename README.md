# 🔥 Flow-Streak

**For every serial procrastinator who needs 47 tries to finish one task.**

An accessible, beautiful focus timer app that turns your chaotic work sessions into satisfying contribution squares. Because if you're gonna procrastinate, at least make it look productive.

## 📖 The Story

Hi, I'm a recovering procrastinator. Actually, scratch that—I'm still procrastinating. But now I track it.

This app is for everyone who:
- Opens 23 browser tabs "for research"
- Says "I'll start after this video"
- Works in 11-minute bursts between existential crises
- Needs to see their "productivity" visualized to feel accomplished

**FlowStreak** doesn't judge your 47 attempts to write one email. It just tracks them. And makes them look cool.

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Traditional productivity apps**: "MAXIMIZE YOUR OUTPUT! CRUSH YOUR GOALS! 🚀💪"

**FlowStreak**: "Hey, you focused for 25 minutes today. That's 25 more than yesterday. Nice."

We believe in:
- **Progress over perfection** - Some days you get 2 hours, some days you get 10 minutes. Both count.
- **Visibility** - Seeing your work visualized helps. Even the messy parts.
- **No guilt trips** - Broke your streak? Cool, start a new one tomorrow.
- **Lazy efficiency** - Work smarter, not harder. Then nap.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built with:
- **React Native + Expo** - Because we're lazy (efficient)
- **TypeScript** - For when our ADHD brain forgets what variables mean
- **AsyncStorage** - Local data, because we don't need another account
- **Accessible components** - Screen readers, high contrast, proper semantics

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? Have an idea? Procrastinating on your actual work?

**Open an issue or PR!** 

I promise to review it... eventually. (I'm working on it, okay?)

## 💡 Why This Exists

I spent 3 years trying to "fix" my work habits. Tried every app. Every technique. Every productivity YouTuber's advice.

Then I realized: **I don't need to fix myself. I need to work WITH how my brain actually works.**

Some days I hyperfocus for 4 hours. Some days I get 3 x 15-minute bursts. Both are valid.

This app is for everyone who's tired of toxic productivity culture. Let's normalize doing work in weird, inconsistent, perfectly human ways.

## 💬 Final Note

If you're reading this README instead of working on what you're supposed to be doing...

**Same, friend. Same.**

Now open the timer and let's at least *try* for 15 minutes. 

We got this!!
